              Your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed. If we cannot obtain an apostille for your FBI criminal background check, we will refund your money 100%.
              We apostille hundreds of FBI background checks every week. We will make sure your forms are filled correctly, go to the right government office, and that you get your documents back on time. If you are planning on working, living, adopting, getting married, or obtaining dual citizenship in a foreign country, you will need to provide an Apostille on an FBI Criminal Background Check. We expedite the process by hand-carrying each report to the U.S. Department of State, where we request Apostilles in person. We can obtain the apostille in 5 days from the day we receive your online order.
